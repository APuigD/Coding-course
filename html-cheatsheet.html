    <h1>Headers and paragraphs</h1>
    <p>That was a paragraph, which you do with a "<code>h1</code>" tag. You can also do different sizes with "<code>h2</code>", "<code>h3</code>"</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph, which you do with a "<code>p</code>" tag.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I added a break with a "<code>br</code>" tag - a line breaker.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>You can create 2 types of lists <strong>Unordered lists</strong> and <strong>Ordered lists</strong> :
    <br>
     An unordered list is done with a "<code>ul</code>" tag and looks like this:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Un</li>
       <li>Dos</li>
       <li>Tres</li>
     </ul>
     <p>An ordered list is done with a "<code>ol</code>" tag and looks like this:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Un</li>
       <li>Dos</li>
       <li>Tres</li>
     </ol>
     <br>
     <h2>Images</h2>
     <p>This is some of the fun stuff to do, such as adding images, which you do with the "<code>img</code>" tag. Note that this tag <strong>doesn't need a closing tag</strong>!
     </p>

         <img src="https://www.catster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Leonard-Nimoy-Spock-Cat-HERO.jpg" alt="Spock with his black cat" width="400px">


     <p>What another one? Here you go:</p>

     <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/98/6d/30/986d30bc5de33e4933474f6de9e84439.jpg" alt="Data with his cat" width="400px">
     <p>To do this I needed to add an <em>attribute</em> into the "img" tag: ' src="..." ' . This can be linked to an image with a full url, or an image from the same folder ie ./image.png</p>
     <p><strong>Very important!</strong> <br> <em>Remember to add the "alt" attribute so it displays text if the image is not supported.</em></p>

     <h2>Other cool stuff such as links</h2>
     <p>Of course you can link things! To do that you us the <code>a</code> (anchor) tag, and just like the image tag, you need to add a "src". An example: <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~ruchill/lazycurator.html">This cool title generator</a>.
       <br> If you want it to open the link in a new window, just add the attribute "target: _blank". For example: <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~ruchill/lazycurator.html" target="_blank"></a>   </p>
